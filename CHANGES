 TO-DO:
 -------
  - Allow destination matches based on DB search OR an existing dialplan variable (maybe from a previous search)
 ** unnecessary ** Can be done with SQL query SELECT('${var}')
 - Section for ad-hoc setting of Asterisk dialplan variables (as going through routes, may want to set some vars and route based on those later) 
 ** unnecessary ** Can be done with SQL query SELECT('${var}') & var to assign is one of 5 

 - Notes field to record descriptions of what the routes are doing
 - Better identification of sql returns by counting commas outside parens
 - Only allow call tracking if we can auto-configure the DB for local asterisk and then auto-configure the search with a couple options
 - Section for ad-hoc setting of Asterisk dialplan variables (as going through routes, may want to set some vars and route based on those later)
